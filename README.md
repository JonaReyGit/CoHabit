# CoHabit :house:
## Roommate-matching application in which two or more people can match based on their set preferences.
The purpose of CoHabit is to facilitate finding suitable roommates in a safe and reliable manner. We strive to achieve reliability by allowing users to implement filters depending on their specific needs and preferences, such as:
* spacial preferences
* location preferences
* gender preferences 

As well as allowing user-to-user communication to establish broader rules and preferences, such as:

* cleanliness
* sleep schedules
* guest rules
* financial responsibilities

We also strive to ensure our users' safety by conducting user screenings prior to registration, as this will also increase confidence in the matching process and reduce some of the stress that comes with finding a suitable roommate.
