# CoHabit
## Roommate-matching application in which two or more people can match based on their set preferences.
The purpose of CoHabit is to facilitate finding suitable roommates in a safe and reliable manner. We strive to achieve this by allowing users to implement filters depending on their specific needs and preferences, such as:
* spacial preferences
* location preferences
* gender preferences 

As well as allowing user-to-user communication to establish broader rules and preferences, such as:

* cleanliness
* sleep schedules
* guest rules
* financial responsibilities
